Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

1. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
2. Run `truffle test` to run tests associated with your solidity smart contracts. The test folder for this can be found in the `test` directory at the root level of this project
